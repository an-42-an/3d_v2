# 3D XO (Tic‑Tac‑Toe)

A simple **3D Tic‑Tac‑Toe (XO)** game built to play with friends, and also experiment with game logic.
Play at: https://threed-v2.onrender.com

## Features

* 3D grid–based XO gameplay
* Turn‑based player interaction
* Win detection across 3D planes


## Notes

This project is functional and playable, but the focus so far has been on **correct 3D logic rather than final UI design**. 
**UI is not fully finished** yet, will be added incrementally.
